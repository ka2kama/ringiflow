## Getting Started

Development environment setup: [Procedures](docs/60_手順書/01_開発参画/01_開発環境構築.md)

For working on multiple tasks simultaneously: [Parallel development (Worktree)](docs/60_手順書/04_開発フロー/04_並行開発（Worktree）.md)

```bash
# Initial setup (install dependencies, start DB, run migrations)
just setup

# Start dev servers (BFF, Core Service, Auth Service, Web — all at once)
just dev-all

# Pre-commit check (lint + test + API test)
just check-all
```

## Development Flow

Tasks are managed with GitHub Projects + Issues.

1. Create or review an Issue
2. Create a branch in the `feature/123-feature-name` format
3. Implement → Create PR (link with `Closes #123`)
4. CI + AI review → Merge

## Project Philosophy

### Maximize Learning

Articulate and record the reasoning behind every design decision.

- Why was this technology or pattern chosen?
- What alternatives were considered, and why were they rejected?
- What are the trade-offs?

**Key learning themes:**
- CQRS + Event Sourcing
- Concurrent updates and state consistency (optimistic locking, conflict resolution, UI synchronization)
- Multi-tenant architecture

### Pursue Quality

Systematically pursue software quality based on the [ISO/IEC 25010](https://iso25000.com/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010) product quality model, currently focusing on maintainability, functional suitability, and security.

The quality strategy consists of two layers — V&V (Validation & Verification):

| Layer | Question | Mechanism |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Validation | Are we solving the right problem? | [Problem-solving framework](.claude/rules/problem-solving.md), [Issue triage](docs/60_手順書/04_開発フロー/01_Issue駆動開発.md#既存-issue-の精査) |
| Verification | Are we building it correctly? | Defense & Offense (below) |

The Verification layer has two complementary directions:

| Direction | Focus | Mechanism |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Defense (defect removal) | Negative → Zero: detect and fix problems | Design review, quality checklists |
| Offense (design improvement) | Zero → Positive: discover and integrate better structures | Design review, [design-principle lenses](docs/60_手順書/04_開発フロー/02_TDD開発フロー.md#設計原則レンズ) in TDD Refactor |

**Design principles:**
- Keep it simple (KISS)
- Separate concerns clearly
- Localize the impact of changes

**Leverage the type system:**
- Make invalid states unrepresentable
- Prefer compile-time errors over runtime errors

### Common Approach: Start from Best Practices

Start from industry best practices and adjust to fit the project's context.

- Set the bar high (start from best practices, then adapt)
- Apply to every domain (code design, UI/UX, security, testing, development process — no exceptions)
- Adjust consciously (document the reason when deviating)

## AI-Driven Development

Development is led by an AI agent (Claude Code), with guardrails to ensure quality.

| Role | Actor | Responsibilities |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Owner | Human | Direction setting, review, final decisions |
| Implementer | Claude Code | Design, implementation, testing, documentation |
| Reviewer | Claude Code Action | Automated PR review |

### AI Behavioral Rules

[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) (~400 lines) and [26 rule files](.claude/rules/) structurally govern the AI's behavior. The AI doesn't write freely — it follows rules.

Key rules:

- [Issue-driven development](docs/60_手順書/04_開発フロー/01_Issue駆動開発.md) / [TDD](docs/60_手順書/04_開発フロー/02_TDD開発フロー.md) enforcement — Verify the Issue before coding; write tests first
- [Pre-implementation checklist](.claude/rules/pre-implementation.md) — Confirm type definitions and existing patterns before writing; no guessing
- [Design-implementation rhythm](.claude/rules/zoom-rhythm.md) — Alternate between big-picture and detail views; only submit when the gap between ideal and actual reaches zero
- [Problem-solving framework](.claude/rules/problem-solving.md) — Don't jump to fixes; think through essential purpose → ideal state → current state → root cause
- [Best-practices-first](.claude/rules/latest-practices.md) — Both technology selection and [methodology design](.claude/rules/methodology-design.md) start from industry best practices
- [Auto-generate documentation](CLAUDE.md#ドキュメント自動作成ルール) — ADRs for technology choices, knowledge base for new patterns, session logs for design decisions

### Improvement Feedback Loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["AI makes a mistake"] --> B["Root cause analysis"]
    B --> C["Record in improvement log"]
    C --> D["Revise CLAUDE.md / rules"]
    D --> E["AI behavior changes"]
    E -.->|Next session| A
```

Currently [110 improvement records](process/improvements/) exist. Examples:

| Case | Problem | Countermeasure |
|------|---------|----------------|
| [YAGNI/KISS misapplication](process/improvements/2026-02/2026-02-01_0004_YAGNI-KISSの拡大解釈による設計品質低下.md) | AI used YAGNI to justify compromising design quality | Added rule to distinguish feature scope from design quality |
| [Missing E2E perspective](process/improvements/2026-01/2026-01-29_1304_E2E視点の完了基準欠如.md) | API works but unusable from UI | Added E2E perspective to completion criteria |
| [Self-verification not executed](process/improvements/2026-02/2026-02-05_2100_自己検証ループの自動実行欠如.md) | Instructions to "verify" were ignored | Shifted from behavioral norms to deliverable requirements for structural enforcement |

### Operational Cycle: Diagnose → Reflect → Act

In addition to improvement records, the project regularly diagnoses and reflects on overall health.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["/assess (monthly)<br/>Health diagnosis"] --> B["/retro (weekly)<br/>Improvement cycle review"]
    B --> C["Create Issues"]
    C --> D["/next<br/>Pick next task"]
    D --> E["Implement"]
    E -.-> A
```

- `/assess`: Diagnose across 3 axes — Discovery (unstarted features) / Delivery (backlog) / Sustainability (technical health)
- `/retro`: Evaluate improvement effectiveness, recurrence rate & MTTR analysis, Toil analysis, error-budget thinking
- `/next`: Select next work item, including actions created from diagnosis results

### Quality Strategy: Validation & Verification

Quality is ensured through two layers: Validation (solving the right problem?) and Verification (building it correctly?).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Issue triage<br/>Validation"] --> B["Design"] --> C["Design review<br/>Defense + Offense"]
    C --> D["Implementation<br/>Design-principle lenses (Offense)"]
    D --> E["Pre-submit check<br/>Defense"]
    E --> F["PR review<br/>Merge"]
```

- Issue triage: Validate Issue assumptions, scope, and completion criteria using the [problem-solving framework](.claude/rules/problem-solving.md)
- Design review: [Iterate design reviews](.claude/rules/zoom-rhythm.md#設計ブラッシュアップループ) until gaps reach zero before implementation
- Design-principle lenses: Answer [SRP, DIP, Simple Design questions](docs/60_手順書/04_開発フロー/02_TDD開発フロー.md#設計原則レンズ) during TDD Refactor to find improvement opportunities
- Pre-submit check: Catch remaining issues with the [quality checklist](docs/60_手順書/04_開発フロー/01_Issue駆動開発.md#62-品質チェックリスト), and include Self-review in the PR
